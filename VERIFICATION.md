# Verification report

Every claim below was produced by running the thing, not by reading the code.

**Re-measured 2026-08-11** on `0863bd6`, Linux, Node v24.13.0 / npm 11.6.2 /
tsc 5.9.3. The original column was measured against upstream before this fork
downgraded to Expo SDK 54 and stubbed HealthKit (`9111415`). Two gates hold, two
moved, and two fail. Nothing below has been repaired — this is a measurement.

**Neither reproduce command runs to completion.** `npm run check` chains with
`&&` and starts with `npm run lint`, which exits 2 because no `eslint.config.js`
exists (see *What is NOT built*). `npm run data:build` exits 1 because it needs a
USDA FDC dataset that is not in the repository. Run the gates individually.

| Gate | Command | Originally | Measured 2026-08-11 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit + property + integration tests | `npx vitest run` | **252 passed**, 13 files | ✅ **341 passed**, 24 files |
| Typecheck — packages | `tsc -p tsconfig.json` | clean, strict | ❌ **27 errors** |
| Typecheck — app | `tsc --noEmit` in `apps/mobile` | clean, strict | ❌ **1 error** |
| Node-purity gate | `node scripts/check-node-purity.mjs` | **11/11 packages** React-Native-free | ✅ **11/11**, unchanged |
| Corpus golden queries | `npm run data:verify` | **26/26 passed**, corpus accepted | ✅ **26/26**, unchanged |
| iOS bundle | `expo export --platform ios` | **1,597 modules**, 3.7 MB | ⚠️ **1,685 modules**, 4.94 MB |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | *(not listed)* | ❌ no ESLint config |
| Corpus build | `npm run data:build` | *(not listed)* | ❌ dataset not in repo |

**Tests moved up, not down.** 341 in 24 files, including `eval/src/scorers.test.ts`
(14 tests) — the scorers are implemented and covered. The harness that would run
them against a golden set is still absent; see *What is NOT built*.

**The packages typecheck was never clean.** All 27 errors reproduce identically on
a pristine `upstream/main` worktree, so this is not fork drift: 25 are `TS4111`
in `packages/prompt/src/wire-transforms.ts` and its test — index-signature
properties reached with dot access, which is precisely what
`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` forbids — and 2 are `TS2345` in
`packages/totals/src/totals.test.ts:141`, a `MacroTotals` literal missing the
required `sugar_g`. The "clean, strict" claim and the code that violates it
arrived in the same commit, `08a342b`.

**The app typecheck failure is fork-introduced.**
`apps/mobile/src/health/healthkit.ts:51` imports
`@kingstinct/react-native-healthkit`, which upstream declared as `^14.0.2` and
which `9111415` removed when it stubbed HealthKit for Expo Go. The specifier is
still imported; the dependency and its types are gone.

**The bundle grew.** SDK 57 → 54 changed the module graph: 1,685 modules against
the claimed 1,597. The 4.94 MB is the `.hbc` bundle; the 4.91 MB `nutrition.db`
ships beside it as an asset, not inside it.

Strict mode means `strict` plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`,
`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` and `verbatimModuleSyntax`. Two of the bugs
below were caught by those flags alone — and, as measured above, two files have
never satisfied them.

## What the tests actually prove

### The two defining bugs are structurally impossible

**A 27-million-calorie output cannot reach a user.** `@nutai/clamp` recomputes
calories from macros via Atwater whenever the model's own figure disagrees by
more than 15%, and the test asserts the string `27000000` appears nowhere in the
output. This runs on every scan, on both inference paths, and is not skippable.
It ships *before* any LLM verifier, not instead of one: a second model call to
check the first model's arithmetic costs money, adds latency, and can itself be
wrong. Arithmetic cannot.

**A macro edit cannot leave calories stale.** The reported failure — protein
edited 226 g → 175 g with calories frozen at 2,964 kcal — is unreachable because
no field exists for a stale total to live in. Totals derive from
`(grams, per-100g snapshot)` on every read. A **500-run property test** over
arbitrary add / remove / edit-grams / set-fraction sequences asserts the total
always equals the sum of its own rows. A single-example test would not have
caught the original bug either, because it only appears after a specific
*sequence*.

### The pipeline works against real data, not fixtures

`packages/pipeline/src/pipeline.corpus.test.ts` runs the real pipeline against
the real 7,928-food corpus:

- A three-item plate resolves every item to a genuine USDA row — **zero** fall to
  the AI-estimate path
- **Twenty common foods resolve with zero zero-hits**, well under the 5% rate that
  §5.5 sets as the trigger to add an embedding layer
- Displayed calories are reproducible from displayed macros across ten real foods
- No item exceeds a physically possible energy density
- A full scan completes in **under 500 ms**

### Honesty is measurable, not aspirational

The merge gate blocks a prediction that is only **4% off** — an excellent MAPE —
because its band claimed ±1% and missed the truth. That is the ship-blocker the
whole product rests on: being wrong is survivable, claiming confidence you have
not earned is not.

`baselines.json` self-declares `provenance: "seeded"` and every stratum carries a
citation for where its number came from. It flips to `"measured"` only after a
real golden-set run.

## Nine real bugs found and fixed

Listed because each one was a genuine defect, not a test adjustment.

1. **The clamp rejected real food.** `MAX_KCAL_PER_100G` was 900 on the reasoning
   that "pure fat is ~884". Real USDA data says otherwise: `Fat, beef tallow`,
   `Lard` and every fish oil in SR Legacy are **902 kcal/100 g**, because USDA
   applies a food-specific Atwater factor of 9.02 kcal/g rather than the rounded
   9. Anyone logging a spoon of lard would have been told their food was
   physically impossible. Raised to 920. *Found by the golden-query gate running
   against the actual corpus — which is the entire argument for having it.*

2. **One bad number killed a whole scan.** `model_gram_estimate` carried
   `.max(5000)` in Zod, so a single absurd value on one item of a five-item meal
   rejected the **entire payload** and the user got nothing back from a scan they
   paid for. Range checks belong to the clamp, which nulls the value and lets the
   ladder fall through. Structural violations still fail the payload; value-range
   violations no longer do.

3. **A type lie.** `ResolvedFood.foodId` was declared `string` while SQLite
   returns `INTEGER`. TypeScript was satisfied; every `===` downstream silently
   failed.

4. **Non-independence in the spec's own algorithm.** A trusted personal prior is
   computed *as* `model_estimate × ratio`, so blending it back against
   `model_guess` diluted the user's own correction with the very number they were
   correcting — and did so *harder* the more consistent they had been. A user who
   corrects 150 g → 200 g five times now sees 200, not 189.

5. **Double-counted uncertainty.** The band composed the pathway floor and the
   measured spread in quadrature when they describe the same quantity, inflating
   `packaged_exact`'s honest ±2% to ±2.8%.

6. **`better-sqlite3` throws synchronously** on a constraint violation, so
   `return Promise.resolve(stmt.run(...))` threw before a promise existed and a
   caller using `.catch()` on an async-looking interface would never see it.

7. **Metro vs. Node module resolution.** `packages/*` use explicit `./foo.js`
   specifiers because Node requires that when consuming built `dist/` — and the
   eval harness does exactly that. `tsc` and Vitest map `.js` → `.ts`; Metro takes
   it literally and fails. Fixed in `metro.config.js` rather than by dropping the
   extensions (breaks the Node build) or pointing the app at `dist/` (would mean
   the app runs different bytes from the harness).

8. **`newArchEnabled` no longer exists** in `ExpoConfig` — the New Architecture is
   the default in SDK 57 and the option was removed.

9. **The spec's assumed `reanimated ~4.1` cannot install** against SDK 57: it
   peer-deps to RN 0.78–0.82 and the SDK ships RN 0.86.

## Two research gaps closed

**FDC column names, previously UNCONFIRMED.** Two prior research passes could not
read USDA's field-description PDF (403 both times), so the shape of
`food_portion` was a guess. Verified against the real file: `id, fdc_id, seq_num,
amount, measure_unit_id, portion_description, modifier, gram_weight`. The build
validates every header and fails loudly on a mismatch.

**A self-contradiction in `SPEC-accuracy-engine.md` §6.3.** The stated rounding
rule ("one decimal for grams under 10 g") contradicts its own worked example,
which rounds 6.19 g fat to `6` and reports 466 kcal. We follow the stated rule
(6.2 g → 468 kcal): it preserves information that matters at a ~60 g daily fat
target, and the property that counts — displayed calories derived from displayed
macros — holds either way. Documented at the test.

## What is NOT built

Stated plainly so nothing here reads as more finished than it is.

**Blocked on you, by design:**
- Path B on-device inference (M3) — needs your physical iPhone/Android
- Golden-set ground truth (M4) — needs a kitchen scale and real food; ~40–60
  dishes after the Nutrition5k import, down from the plan's 200
- Store submission (M7) — needs your Apple and Google accounts

**Not built:**
- Onboarding (12 screens), goals UI, key-entry screen
- Trends / Foods / You are placeholder screens
- Offline queue, barcode scanning UI, saved meals, custom foods
- HealthKit, Health Connect, widgets (M6)
- Branded-foods tier and the five verified-open national tables (UK CoFID, Japan
  MEXT, France CIQUAL, Germany BLS, Australia FSANZ) — the pipeline is built and
  they are additive stages
- ESLint config, so `npm run lint` currently fails; the three M0 rules do not
  exist yet
- No dev-client build has run on physical hardware

Honestly: **M0 and M0.5 complete, M1 complete, M2 and M5–M8 untouched.** Roughly
8–10 of the plan's 20+ engineer-weeks.
