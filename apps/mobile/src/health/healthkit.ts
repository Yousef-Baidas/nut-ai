/**
 * HealthKit.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES THIS WHOLE FILE: on iOS, a READ permission never
 * reports whether it was granted. `requestAuthorization` resolves the same way
 * whether the user tapped Allow or Don't Allow, by design — Apple treats "this
 * app knows you declined to share heart data" as itself a privacy leak.
 *
 * So there is no such thing as "check if we have read access". The only honest
 * signal is whether a query returns anything, and an empty result is genuinely
 * ambiguous: no permission, or no data. Every function here is written to be
 * correct under that ambiguity rather than pretending it can tell the difference.
 *
 * Everything is dynamically imported. The module is iOS-only and pulls in a
 * native Nitro module; importing it eagerly would break Android and make the
 * whole app fail to start if the pod were ever missing.
