 *
 *   Keychain / Keystore via expo-secure-store, ONE ENTRY PER PROVIDER — never one
 *   combined JSON blob, so a corrupt or revoked key for one provider cannot take
 *   the others with it.
 *
 *   Written ONLY from runtime user input. Never from EXPO_PUBLIC_*, app.config,
 *   .env, or EAS secrets — anything in those ships inside the bundle and is
 *   readable by anyone who downloads the app.
 *
 *   Read at exactly ONE place (the cloud request builder) and sent to exactly
 *   one destination: the provider the user named.
 *
 * The biometric gate is on REVEAL/EDIT in settings only, never on read-for-scan.
 * Putting Face ID in front of every meal photo is how a privacy feature becomes
 * the reason someone stops logging.
