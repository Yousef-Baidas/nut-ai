/**
 * The deterministic sanity clamp.
 *
 * docs/inherited-design.md I §3.4. **Always on. Every scan. Both inference paths.
 * Non-LLM. Near-zero cost. Never skippable.**
 *
 * This is the direct countermeasure to the most embarrassing documented failure in
 * this product category — an approximately 27-million-calorie output, observed
 * across two independent research passes. It ships BEFORE any LLM-based verifier,
 * not instead of one: a second model call to check the first model's arithmetic
 * costs money, adds latency, and can itself be wrong. Arithmetic cannot.
 *
 * A flag never silently deletes an item. It degrades it honestly — three effects,
 * all downstream of this function:
 *   (a) the flag is recorded on the log entry, for support and for the eval harness
 *   (b) the item's confidence is forced to the lowest band
 *   (c) a visible "please check this one" marker is surfaced in the UI
 *
 * Unlike the spec's reference implementation, this is PURE — it returns a new
 * payload rather than mutating its input. The eval harness replays the same
 * payload through multiple pipeline configurations, and in-place mutation would
 * silently contaminate run N+1 with run N's corrections.
