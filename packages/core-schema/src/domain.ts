/**
 * The stored domain model.
 *
 * SPEC-accuracy-engine.md §6.1. One invariant pays for the entire product:
 *
 *   Every ingredient row, regardless of origin, is stored as
 *   (food_reference, grams, per-100g nutrient snapshot) — NEVER as a bare
 *   calorie or macro number.
 *
 * Everything good downstream falls out of that:
 *   - Corrections are free, instant, and offline forever — whether the scan
 *     came from a cloud model or the deterministic local pipeline — because a
 *     correction is arithmetic over values already on device.
 *   - Historical logs never silently change when the nutrition database updates,
 *     because the snapshot was copied at add time and is immutable thereafter.
 *   - Saved meals survive any database update for the same reason.
 *
 * The alternative — storing opaque totals — is what forces a second paid model
 * call to fix a wrong number, and what lets a database update rewrite what you
 * ate last March.
