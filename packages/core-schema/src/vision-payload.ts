/**
 * VisionPayload — the ONLY thing an inference model is allowed to return.
 *
 * docs/inherited-design.md I §3.1–3.2. One canonical schema, three emitted provider
 * shapes, one client-side validator that runs for all of them.
 *
 * The governing rule (docs/inherited-design.md II D16) is visible in the shape of this type:
 *
 *   The model is a perception device. It never owns a number the user sees.
 *
 * It reports what it can actually see — identity, form, relative size, reference
 * objects, cooking cues, legible text, and what it could NOT determine. Grams are
 * computed downstream by @nutai/gram-engine. Nutrition comes from a database row
 * via @nutai/resolver. Totals are arithmetic in @nutai/totals. Confidence comes
 * from measured per-category error in @nutai/confidence.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions carry most of the weight:
 *
 * 1. There is NO `meal_totals` field. Not "present but ignored" — absent. A field
 *    we always discard is paid output tokens plus a standing temptation to render
 *    it. Its absence is what makes a macro-reconciliation mismatch unreachable
 *    rather than merely guarded against.
 *
 * 2. The mass field is `model_gram_estimate`, not `estimated_grams`. It sits at
 *    rank 5 of 6 in the reconciliation ladder. A field named `estimated_grams`
 *    invites a developer to display it; this one does not.
