/**
 * The one database interface, with two implementations.
 *
 * PLAN.md §4.1 calls this "the one non-obvious architectural requirement", and it
 * is the reason the whole `packages/*` purity rule exists:
 *
 *   The eval harness must import the REAL gram engine and the REAL resolver and
 *   run them under Node against the golden set. Without a Node-runnable database,
 *   the harness could only score raw model output — which measures the wrong
 *   thing, because the gram engine and resolver sit between the model and the
 *   number a user sees, and that is where much of the accuracy lives. `eval/`
 *   (see `eval/src/runner.ts`) does exactly this — the golden set is currently
 *   seeded (synthetic, provenance-labelled); kitchen-scale-weighed cases replace
 *   it case by case.
 *
 * WHERE THE TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS LIVE, and why they are split:
 *
 *   - better-sqlite3  -> `@nutai/db-adapter/node`, in this package. Node only.
 *   - expo-sqlite     -> `apps/mobile/src/db`, NOT here.
 *
 * The expo implementation deliberately does not live in this package. `packages/*`
 * must stay importable under bare Node with zero React Native surface, and an
 * `import 'expo-sqlite'` anywhere in here would fail the node-purity gate — which
 * is exactly the gate doing its job. apps/mobile is the only package allowed to
 * hold React Native imports.
 *
 * The interface is ASYNC even though better-sqlite3 is synchronous, because
 * expo-sqlite is not. Making the shared interface async costs the Node side one
 * trivially-resolved promise per call and saves the app side from a lie.
