/**
 * Reconciliation — a trust hierarchy, not an average.
 *
 * docs/inherited-design.md I §4.6.2.
 *
 * The rule that matters: DO NOT SILENTLY AVERAGE. A large disagreement between two
 * independent signals is itself information — arguably the most useful information
 * the pipeline produces, because it is the one case where the app knows it does
 * not know. Blending 140 g and 220 g into 180 g destroys that and replaces it with
 * a confident-looking number that is probably wrong in a way nobody can see.
 *
 * When the threshold fires, the user sees: "We're not sure — does this look more
 * like 140 g or 220 g?" with both numbers as taps. That question exists only
 * because we kept two independent estimates instead of collapsing them.
