 * docs/inherited-design.md I §4. The whole justification in one number: Gemini 2.5
 * Flash's carbohydrate MAPE moved 56.6% (no weight info) -> 39.5% (predicted
 * weight) -> 20.2% (ground-truth weight). Knowing the mass collapses error by
 * roughly two thirds — a larger lever than any model upgrade, and it is realized
 * by deterministic tables plus a portion-confirmation UI, not a smarter model.
 *
 * And the reason we buy no hardware for it: DPF-Nutrition measured RGB-only at
 * 20.9% mean PMAE, software-predicted depth at 17.8%, and a real depth sensor at
 * 17.2%. LiDAR buys 0.6 percentage points. Not worth Pro-device fragmentation
 * plus custom native code on two platforms.
