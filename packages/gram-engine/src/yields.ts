 * The yield figures are CONFIRMED from the USDA Table of Cooking Yields for Meat
 * and Poultry (Showell et al., USDA ARS Nutrient Data Laboratory, December 2012),
 * public domain as a US government work. Real wet-lab measurements — moisture via
 * AOAC 950.46, fat via acid hydrolysis — not estimates. Core equation, verbatim:
 *
 *   Yield (%) = 100 x (Wch / Wcr)      cooked-hot weight over raw weight
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING RULE: yields are food-class-specific lookups. There is no
 * generic meat constant anywhere in this file, and there must not be one anywhere
 * in the codebase. Bacon yields 29–32% — roughly 70% of raw weight lost to
 * rendered fat and moisture — while cured ham-and-water product yields 96%. A
 * pipeline applying a generic "meat ~= 75%" to bacon is not slightly off; it is
 * structurally, wildly wrong.
