/**
 * Stage [2] LOCAL SIGNALS — the user-message context block.
 *
 * docs/inherited-design.md I §1.1 stage 2 and §2.3.
 *
 * THE CRITICAL RULE: this block is a LABELED TEXT BLOCK in the user message. It is
 * never merged into the cached system-prompt prefix. Two independent reasons:
 *
 *   1. Prompt caching. The system prompt is identical on every request and is the
 *      thing worth caching; splicing per-scan context into it would invalidate the
 *      cache on every single scan and multiply cost.
 *   2. Provenance. Context about THIS user's containers and habits is data, not
 *      instruction. Keeping it in the user turn, clearly labeled, means the model
 *      cannot mistake a food name in the user's own history for a directive.
 *
 * The value of this block is externally corroborated: ACETADA (Purdue controlled-
 * feeding RCT, food weighed to 0.1 g) measured contextual metadata improving
 * calorie MAE by roughly 76 kcal on average across GPT-4o, Claude and Gemini.
